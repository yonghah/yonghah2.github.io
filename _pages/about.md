I am Yongha Hwang. I am leading a development team of MGIS, a space information system for indoor spaces at the University of Michigan. The system was originally developed for the University of Michigan Medical School when I was a PhD student in Architecture. The system is now utilized across the whole campus.  

My research interest during the PhD was to quantitatively analyze the effect of workspace's layout on collaboration behavior. While working on that, I realized that tools for quantitative analysis are scarce in this field despite recent dazzling advances in data sciences in other fields. My current interest is to help the inquiry of architecture with such advances in data sciences. 

MGIS is one of the results in this vein. It is my exploration on how to visualize floor plans and how to convert CAD drawings to a better data format to be analyzed.
